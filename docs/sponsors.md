## OnAir Music

We also work with [OnAir Music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7IYLENV1pGGPvL6wkyl7t5), a collection of royalty-free music for use in Twitch streams and other applications. OnAir has also contributed a [stem dataset for AI music demixing research](https://github.com/sevagh/OnAir-Music-Dataset) to help researchers develop better AI stem separation applications (like the one that powers this website).
