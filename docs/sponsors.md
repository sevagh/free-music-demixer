# Sponsors

We are eager to establish partnerships in the domains of pro audio recording, production, and any slice of the music industry related to mixing, remixing, demixing, and stem separation.

The current format is 160px-wide skyscraper ad banners on the left side of the website, provided directly by our sponsors, that redirect to our sponsors' chosen link. The ads are dynamically resized for smaller screen sizes but are always present on every page of the site.

If you offer a pro demixing service, we can explore a deeper partnership where this site is encouraged for free proofs of stems for the user's demo project, and the user is funneled to your pro service for the final stems.

Interested? [Contact us!](mailto:sevagh+freemdx@protonmail.com)
