# free-music-demixer

A [free static website](https://freemusicdemixer.com) for client-side music demixing (aka music source separation) with the Demucs v4 hybrid transformer AI model. It runs on CloudFlare Pages.

**The paid [PRO site](https://pro.freemusicdemixer.com)** contains higher-quality custom ensemble models.

[demucs.cpp](https://github.com/sevagh/demucs.cpp): transliterated the original PyTorch model Python code to C++ with Eigen3, compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten. No quantization: the weights of Demucs v4 `htdemucs` and `htdemucs_6s` are 81 MB and 53 MB respectively, stored as float16. Anything smaller affects the quality of the network, and compression only gets down to ~70 MB: not worth the extra loading time.

### Dev instructions

The [wav-file-encoder](https://github.com/chdh/wav-file-encoder) project has been vendored in; I manually compiled the Typescript file to Javascript with these commands:
```
npm install typescript
npx tsc --module es6 ../vendor/wav-file-encoder/src/WavFileEncoder.ts
```

## Demucs v4

Fewer memory issues from segmented design (largest track tested is ~7 minutes, 'Georgia Wonder - Siren').

'Georgia Wonder - Siren' (takes ~41 minutes):
```

'Georgia Wonder - Siren', ~9 minutes with 8 workers:
```

```

'Zeno - Signs' (takes ~20 minutes):
```

```

'Zeno - Signs', ~5 minutes with 8 workers, 0.75s overlap + weighted sum (same as demucs segmenting):
```
vocals          ==> SDR:   8.297  SIR:  18.114  ISR:  15.731  SAR:   8.335

bass            ==> SDR:   4.054  SIR:  12.487  ISR:   6.728  SAR:   3.035
other           ==> SDR:   7.349  SIR:  11.118  ISR:  14.236  SAR:   8.159
```
(best sound to my ears/least segment boundaries, anecdotally)
